    text: "I am a passionate and self-driven technology enthusiast currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA - 3rd year). I enjoy building practical projects that solve real problems, especially in web development, AI, and automation. Over time, I've developed strong skills in Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, Pandas, and NumPy, and I actively work on improving my knowledge of DSA and full-stack development.",

  {
    text: "I love experimenting with new tools and technologies—whether it's WebAssembly, FastMCP, AI agents, chatbots, or CNN-based ML projects. I've built projects like a LinkedIn scraper, COVID-19 detection system, JavaScript animations, AI summarizers, business chatbots, and more. I'm also working on building large-scale ideas such as my own cryptocurrency, an AI-based video summarizer, and an AI startup.",

    text: "I’m highly interested in entrepreneurship, especially building AI-powered solutions for businesses. Alongside coding, I’m also starting a YouTube channel focused on motivation, coding education for beginners, book summaries, and self-improvement, using AI tools to produce high-quality content.",
